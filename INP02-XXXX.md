## Summary
While fuzzing `opensips` I discovered a heap buffer overflow under `strlen` function during a READ operation, indicating an attempt to read beyond the allocated buffer leading to code execution or denial of service under `opnesips` tested against commit "64c0042".

The above commit checks when `getline()` returns -1, the `@lineptr` argument is never safe to read, nor is this recommended.  So when both `rc == -1` and EOF conditions
occur, it is safe to assume we read 0 bytes, without doing the `strlen()`.
